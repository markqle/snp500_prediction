## Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can assist traders in making informed decisions based on historical stock data. By leveraging the Random Forest algorithm, we aim to achieve high accuracy in predicting market movements.

## Data Collection
- Downloaded historical stock data from the S&P 500 index.
- Cleaned and visualized the data to identify trends and patterns.

## Model Development
1. **Target Setup**: Defined the target variable for the model.
2. **Baseline Model**: Trained an initial Random Forest model to establish a baseline performance.
3. **Error Evaluation**: Evaluated model errors and developed a backtesting framework to measure performance over an extended period.
4. **Model Improvement**: Enhanced the model by adding extra predictor columns to improve accuracy.

## Evaluation
The model's performance was assessed using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall. Backtesting results indicate the model's effectiveness in predicting stock movements over time.

## Future Improvements
- **Market Analysis**: Investigate the impact of other trading markets that operate when the US stock market is closed.
- **Incorporate News Data**: Add relevant news articles and economic indicators (e.g., interest rates, unemployment rates) to enhance predictions.
- **Sector Analysis**: Focus on key stocks and sectors that may influence market trends.
- **Resolution Enhancement**: Explore different data resolutions, such as hourly, minute, and tick data, for more granular predictions.

## Installation
